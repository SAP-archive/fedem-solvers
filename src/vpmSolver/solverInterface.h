    \details
    This function processes the input and sets up necessary data structures
    prior to the time integration loop. It also performs the license checks.
    See the Fedem R7.4 Users Guide, Appendix C.3 for a complete list of all
    command-line arguments that may be specified and their default values.

    If the argument \a cfsi is NULL, the model is assumed defined in the file
    specified via the command-line argument -fsifile instead.

    The arguments \a extInput and \a nxinp are used to transfer initial values
    of the external functions to the solver before the initial equilibrirum
    iterations is performed. The argument \a nxinp is reset to zero on exit,
    if initial equilibrium iterations is not performed, and to a negative valiue
    if the array \a extInput is too short.

    The return value is zero on success, a negative value indicates some error.
    If \a cfsi is NULL and \a stateData is NULL, the return value is the
    required minimum length of the array to be used as state vector for restart.
